As things have mostly settled down to rediscoveries of fixed bugs, 
it is time to distribute the first batch of patches and ports.


NOTICE:  The diffs comprising this update batch were cut on NetHack 3.0
         release version.  If you modified any of your files, store them
         and replace with release version files before applying this kit.


Changes made:

Eric Smith provided a port to the Atari using gcc; the older Lattice C 
vestiges moved to different preprocessor options and remain untested.

Ralf Brown adapted NetHack to the Andrew File System.

The fruit naming code was enclosed in a new option, TUTTI_FRUTTI, which 
allows another 3K of object code to be defined out.

Various tweaks, rewritings, and reshufflings to get the code to get along
with various compilers and preprocessors, including Microport SysV/AT 2.4,
Gould UTX/32, HP-UX, and of course Turbo C.

Various suggested changes in behavior, none major.

Distribution of termcap.uu, the uuencoded termcap.arc for PCs that was
previously distributed with NetHack 2.2 and 2.3.

Explicit instructions to short-circuit common installation mistakes.


Bug fixes:

Various segmentation faults no longer exist, including the popular dropping
items in shops.

Vortices can no longer disappear through solid walls when they disgorge you
over a moat.

You now get credit for food when engulfing monsters.

A few more spelling errors that fell through the cracks.


Suggestion for overflowing compiler tables:  follow the SysV-AT trail in the
src Makefile with -DDUMB and DUMB.Setup.  It appears that many SVR2 3Bs will
need to do this.
