General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
Y2K fix: use 4 digit year values for the dates in the score file
updated COPYRIGHT_BANNER_A to reflect year of release
prevent "late" pline calls from triggering a crash when the RIP window was
	displayed at end of game (observed when bones file rename failure
	under Win95 was reported to wizard mode users)
being punished on the Plane of Water doesn't trigger a panic when air bubbles
	try to move the ball&chain or you around
avoid rn2(0) divide by 0 for empty inventory when trying to crawl out of water
don't let randomly placed monsters on special levels prevent explicitly
	placed monsters who target that location from being created (a web
	trap's spider resulted in no quest nemesis)
don't let randomly placed stairs on special levels be covered by explicitly
	placed features such as fountains
pager: guard against '%' in output from being treated as a printf formatting
	directive (using '/' or ';' to look at food yields "% blah blah")
prayer result of ``escape from solid rock'' isn't inhibited by teleport
	restrictions (attempting to fix all troubles got stuck in a loop)
report "file empty?" rather than "version mismatch" when that's the reason
	why a data file fails its validation check
drum of earthquake can't destroy the high altars
