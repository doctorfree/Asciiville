[ Release notes for nethack 3.0 patchlevel 8. ]

This patch is devoted to bugfixes and accommodations for more versions of
the newer ports.

The VMS port should now compile with both VAXC and GNUC and install more
easily under a variety of OS versions, thanks to Joshua Delahunty and Pat
Rankin.

A number of strange interactions in the Macintosh-specific code have been
cleaned up.

The MSDOS overlay manager was debugged, and the overlay assignments and macro
names straightened out, so the result should be both faster and more stable
than previous versions.  See the new file Install.ovl and various files in
the others directory for more information.

The Amiga port now specifies addressing modes for many external variables,
which should make its executable smaller and faster as well.


The biggest externally visible change separates DECgraphics and IBMgraphics
from the general graphics-setting code, and makes them selectable on the
command line.

Once again, existing saved games and bones files should be discarded (or the
update postponed until they are gone).

A number of reasonably simple bugs are no more, although some screen update
oddities are postponed to 3.1.  Among the dead are problems with shops on
bones levels, renaming artifacts, kicking non-objects, winning gem treatment,
level bounds checking and monster filling, mimic appearances, taking items
out of containers, monster interiors and inventories, and guard behavior.
Various other things were changed to be consistent with similar situations.
