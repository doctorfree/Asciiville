# chktermcolor - checks a terminal's color support
#
# There exists common confusion about terminal colors.
# This is what we have right now:
#
#   Plain ASCII
#   ANSI escape codes: 16 color codes with bold/italic and background
#   256 color palette: 216 colors + 16 ANSI + 24 gray (colors are 24-bit)
#   24-bit truecolor: "888" colors (aka 16 million)
#
#   printf "\x1b[${bg};2;${red};${green};${blue}m\n"
#
# The 256-color palette is configured at start and is a 666-cube of colors,
# each of them defined as a 24-bit (888 RGB) color.
#
# This means that current support can only display 256 different colors
# in the terminal while "truecolor" means that you can display 16 million
# different colors at the same time.
#
# Truecolor escape codes do not use a color palette.
# They just specify the color directly.
#
# This is a good test case:
#
#   printf "\x1b[38;2;255;100;0mTRUECOLOR\x1b[0m\n"
#
