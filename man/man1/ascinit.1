.SS NAME
.PP
ascinit - Asciiville initialization script
.SS SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]ascinit\f[R] [-a] [-c] [-d] [-m] [-M] [-n] [-N] [-q] [-r] [-t] [-y]
[-u] [arg]
.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]ascinit\f[R] command should be run as a normal user with
\f[V]sudo\f[R] privilege after installing Asciiville.
It performs several configuration initializations for the user.
These include:
.IP \[bu] 2
The Kitty terminal emulator is installed and configured
.IP \[bu] 2
The Neovim text editor is installed and configured
.IP \[bu] 2
Mutt and/or NeoMutt startup files are customized
.IP \[bu] 2
Tmux configuration is created
.IP \[bu] 2
default Ranger and Rifle configuration files are created
.IP \[bu] 2
Asciimatics and Rainbowstream installation is performed
.IP \[bu] 2
Optionally authorizing the Rainbow Stream app with Twitter
.IP \[bu] 2
Optionally additional terminal emulators can be installed and configured
.IP \[bu] 2
Asciiville profiles in Gnome and Tilix terminals are created, if
installed
.PP
Although command line options are provided to control the action(s) of
the \f[V]ascinit\f[R] command (see below), the typical invocation will
simply be \f[V]ascinit\f[R] with no options.
This default invocation performs a NeoMutt configuration, does not
configure Mutt, configures Tmux and Ranger and Rifle, installs
Asciimatics and Rainbowstream if not already installed, does not
authorize Rainbow Stream with Twitter, installs the Kitty terminal
emulator, installs the Neovim text editor, installs ASCII games, and
creates an Asciiville profile in gnome-terminal and tilix if installed.
.PP
If initialization is being performed on a headless system or a system
without graphical capabilities then execute the command
\f[V]ascinit -c\f[R] rather than \f[V]ascinit\f[R].
When invoked with the \f[V]-c\f[R] option the \f[V]ascinit\f[R] command
will not install the terminal emulators or create the terminal profiles.
.PP
A minimal initialization can be performed with the command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
ascinit minimal
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The \[dq]minimal\[dq] Asciiville initialization does not install
optional components like \f[V]NeoMutt\f[R], \f[V]Neovim\f[R], Ascii
games, \f[V]cbftp\f[R], and \f[V]aewan\f[R].
These components can be installed subsequently by rerunning
\f[V]ascinit\f[R] without arguments.
.PP
An initialization can be performed using Homebrew rather than the native
package manager with the command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
ascinit brew
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In addition to initialization of Asciiville components,
\f[V]ascinit\f[R] can be used to individually install and remove the
ASCII games, Kitty terminal emulator, and Neovim text editor.
To install one of these components, issue the command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
ascinit <component>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
where \f[I]component\f[R] is one of \f[I]games\f[R], \f[I]kitty\f[R], or
\f[I]neovim\f[R].
To remove one of these componenents, run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
ascinit -r <component>
\f[R]
.fi
