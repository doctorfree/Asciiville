####  bind-key
#
# Bind key <key> to <operation>. This means that whenever <key> is pressed,
# then <operation> is executed (if applicable in the current dialog). A list of
# available operations can be found below. Optionally, you can specify a
# dialog. If you specify one, the key binding will only be added to the
# specified dialog. Available dialogs are `all` (default if none is specified),
# `feedlist`, `filebrowser`, `help`, `articlelist`, `article`, `tagselection`,
# `filterselection`, `urlview`, `podbeuter`, and `dirbrowser`.
#
# Syntax: <key> <operation> [<dialog>]
#
# Default value: n/a

####  unbind-key
#
# Unbind key <key>. This means that no operation is called when <key> is
# pressed. If you provide "-a" as <key>, all currently bound keys will become
# unbound. Optionally, you can specify a dialog (for a list of available
# dialogs, see `bind-key` above). If you specify one, the key binding will only
# be unbound for the specified dialog.

# Syntax: <key> [<dialog>]
