.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aewan [\fIfilename\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Aewan is a multi-layered ascii-art/animation editor that produces both
stand-alone cat-able art files and an easy-to-parse format for integration in
your terminal applications (for information about the file format,
see the aewan(5) manpage).

If you invoke the program without a command-line argument, it will
open an untitled document for you to edit. If you supply an argument,
it must be the name of an aewan file you wish to open. That file
must exist, or an error will occur.
