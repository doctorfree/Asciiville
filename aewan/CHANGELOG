1.0.01

 * aecat now accepts "comment" format (which extracts metadata from the file)
   and -L option (which outputs layer count) - contributed by 
   Gerfried Fuchs (alfie@ist.org)
 * corrected aeff (aewan file format) escape sequence interpretation bug
   that was causing special characters in metainfo to get garbled
 * added "resize layer" funcionality, also contributed by 
   Gerfried Fuchs (alfie@ist.org)
 * both 'Load file' and 'Save file' now use dialog boxes that let the
   user browse directories 
 * added a new export utility: aemakeflic, which converts aewan documents
   into animations to be played in the 'less' command or as a shell script
 * added a confirmation question when quitting the program or clearing
   the document to prevent against accidental loss of current work
 * in the version number, the revision will be conventionally written
   with two digits from now on

0.9.7 

 * cleaned up Makefile.in to make the bores/ directory (remnants of a library
   that used to be separate from aewan) compile together with the rest
   of the project instead of separately as libbores.a

0.9.6 - release date: 2005-02-19 (minor bugfix release)

 * fixed segfault bug which resulted from trying to correct cursor coords
   when a layer had just been added (reported in Debian bug tracking system)

0.9.5 - release date: 2005-02-18

 * menu introduced in order to make the interface more friendly
 * "new file" (i.e. clear everything and start from scratch) funcionality added
 * added patches from Gerfried Fuchs (alfie@ist.org):
      - aecat now produces more XHTML-compliant html and supports
        background color
      - user can now manipulate upper-left corner of selection in select mode
