jp2a is distributed under the GNU General Public License v2.  See the file
COPYING for a copy of that license, and how you can apply that license to make
derivative works.

Although I do make use of other libraries, the source distribution does not
include any source-code from these.  However, the win32 version comes with
precompiled library files, so I copy the licenses here.

jp2a makes use of the JPEG library by the Independent JPEG Group.  See
http://www.ijg.org

jp2a makes use of libcurl, which has the following license:

The jp2a win32 binary distribution comes with precompiled OpenSSL binaries from

      LICENSE ISSUES
      ==============

      The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
      the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
      See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
      Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
      please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
