INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X, etc.
---------------------------

  Normally, it should be enough to just run:

	./configure && make

  A single executable "tetris" should then have been created, which may be
  moved anywhere.  You can also run "make install" to install the program
  along with documentation and desktop integration files in /usr/local.

  If you only get error messages from the shell when you run configure, try
  to execute with "bash configure" instead.  If you don't have bash, you will
  have to edit config.mk and then run make.

  Use "./configure help" for a list of build and installation options.

  If you build with Xlib the game will pause automatically when your terminal
  window loses focus.

  By default, vitetris.xpm is installed in pixmapdir and vitetris.desktop
  in desktopdir.  If you don't want them, set those dirs to empty strings
  with configure or uncomment them in config.mk.  That is:

	./configure pixmapdir= desktopdir=

  There is a game server included which can be built with "make gameserver".
  If SAME_LEVEL_HEIGHT is defined, players will be forced to have the same
  start level and height (uncomment in src/netw/gameserver.c).
  See the README under "Network Play" for more information.
