// PLEASE READ
//
// You must define the build configuration setting DEVELOPMENT_TEAM
// in order for the project to build successfully.  This setting provides
// the identifier XCode needs in order to sign your builds.
//
// Your DEVELOPMENT_TEAM can be found by opening Keychain Access
// (found by Finder->Applications->Utilities).  Click on "Login" key chain.
// Click on catagory "My Certificates".
//
// Look for your "Mac Developer" certificate.  Double click on
// the certificate to open a dialog that shows certificate details.
// Look for "Organizational Unit" among the details.  This ten digit value
// is your development team identifier.
//
// Once found, you now need to create a file named "XCodeLocal.xcconfig"
// in the same folder as "XCode.xcconfig".  This file should contain at
// least one line that defines your DEVELOPMENT_TEAM. The line should have
// the form:
//   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = XXXXXXXXXX
//
// If you know what you are doing, it can also have other build settings
// you wish to override.
//
// This new file is ignored by git and should never be submitted to the
// repository.  It is meant to be local to you machine only.
//

// Include locally provided config file that must define DEVELOPMENT_TEAM
#include? "XCodeLocal.xcconfig"
