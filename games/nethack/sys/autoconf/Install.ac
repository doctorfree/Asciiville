                Instructions for installing UnNetHack
                 on a GNU autoconf supported system
                =====================================

1.  If your system is supported by GNU autoconf, then you should just be
    able to change to the top level directory (the one containing the
    sys and src directories, amoung others) and run:

	% ./configure
	% make
	% su -
	# make install

    Notes:
    
    * You do _not_ need to have a copy of GNU autoconf to install UnNetHack.

2.  If you do not like the default set of optional features, then you can
    use the --enable-FEATURE and/or --disable-FEATURE flags to configure
    as required. Use configure --help to get a list of the optional feaures
    available and their default settings.

3.  If the steps above fail for any reason, then your system is probably
    not supported by GNU autoconf and you should use the system-specific
    installation instructions in the relevent subdirectory of sys.

4.  If you think you've found a bug in the automatic configuration system,
    then please report it to <bhaak@gmx.net>.
    If the problem is that configure exited with an error then, as well as
    a cut & paste of the error message, please attach the relevant section
    of config.log (or the whole thing if you're not sure).

5.  If for some reason you need to recreate the configure script, then you
    should use bootstrap.sh for this purpose. You will need autoconf,
    automake and pkgconfig for this step.

6.  config.guess and config.sub come from the GNU config package. They should
    periodically be updated from the official copies. At the time of writing,
    these can be found here:
