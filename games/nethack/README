General information about NetHack
===================================

NetHack is a fork of NetHack, originally based on NetHack version 3.4.3.

It features more randomness, more levels, more challenges and more fun than
vanilla NetHack.

In a nutshell I would describe NetHack as "how NetHack would look today if
the DevTeam didn't stop releasing", following a modern open source project
approach of development.


The project page with detailed information about changes from NetHack, the
development blog, public servers, source code repository and ways to reach the
developer can be found at: https://nethack.wordpress.com/

For discussions, join the IRC channel #nethack on Libera.Chat, post to the
Reddit group r/nethack or the Usenet group rec.games.roguelike.nethack.


 -- Good luck, and happy Hacking
