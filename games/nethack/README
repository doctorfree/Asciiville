General information about UnNetHack
===================================

This is release 5.2.0 of UnNetHack. This release updates the previous version
with bugfixes and new features of the development version 5.3.1 (distribution
packagers therefore don't need to package 5.2.0 if they already ship 5.3.1).

This release is not bones and saves compatible with 5.1.0.

UnNetHack is a fork of NetHack, originally based on NetHack version 3.4.3.

It features more randomness, more levels, more challenges and more fun than
vanilla NetHack.

In a nutshell I would describe UnNetHack as "how NetHack would look today if
the DevTeam didn't stop releasing", following a modern open source project
approach of development.


The project page with detailed information about changes from NetHack, the
development blog, public servers, source code repository and ways to reach the
developer can be found at: https://unnethack.wordpress.com/
