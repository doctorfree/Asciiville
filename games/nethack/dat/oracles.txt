transitory nature.
-----

harder than getting in.
-----
It is well known that wily shopkeepers raise their prices whene'er they
espy the garish apparel of the approaching tourist or the countenance of a
disfavored patron.  They favor the gentle of manner and the fair of face.
The boor may expect unprofitable transactions.
----- SINKS
The cliche of the kitchen sink swallowing any unfortunate rings that contact
its pernicious surface reflecteth greater truth than many homilies, yet
even so, few have developed the skill to identify enchanted rings by the
transfigurations effected upon the voracious device's frame.
-----
The meat of enchanted creatures ofttimes conveyeth magical properties
unto the consumer.  A fresh corpse of floating eye doth fetch a high

obtain these powers.  But verily, such power comes at great cost, to
preserve the balance.

read from Moloch's book, shall cause the earth to tremble mightily.  The
light of an enchanted candelabrum shall show thee the way.
-----
In the deepest recesses of the Dungeons of Doom, guarding access to the
nether regions, there standeth a castle, wherein lieth a wand of wishes.
If thou wouldst gain entry, bear with thee an instrument of music, for the

should they be prepared to circumambulate the castle to the postern.
----- ELBERETH
The name of Elbereth may strike fear into the hearts of thine enemies, if

feet scuff the inscription, cancelling its potence.
