[This is a partial list supplied by Ken Arromdee long after the fact]

General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
dropping a weapon, then picking it up while blind causes it to become 
	unidentified but it remains that way after your vision returns
when blind and feeling the floor, the objects then on the floor should
	have their characteristics become unknown
zapping a wand of probing at yourself works, however using a stethoscope
	on yourself does not
trolls that come back to life don't retain their names
if you look at what is on the ground and there is more than a screenful,
	quantities are not printed (i.e. "food rations")
if pickup was off and you moved onto a spot with both engraving and objects,
	you got told what the engraving was twice
if a Keystone Kop threw a pie and the pie hit a shopkeeper, the shopkeeper
	became angry
"two handed sword" is spelled with and without a hyphen in various places
trying to descend stairs while levitating gives a message where "You're"
	is misspelled as "Your"
the 'V' command gives a history that is not quite correct; it wasn't 
	Ken Arromdee that merged PC Hack and Unix Hack; rather, PC Hack 
	was derived from Unix Hack by Don Kneller.  It was (I think) 
	Mike Stephenson who merged the many Hack versions.
the uranium wand gets described as "an" uranium wand
potions which have been both called and identified have the called instead
	of the identified name printed out
status line at the bottom of the screen is formatted strangely for the
	first 10 moves; after 10 moves it becomes normal
if you polymorph yourself into a rockmole, you are unable to dig through
	rock
a stethoscope or wand of probing, used on a monster, printed out a format
	with spaces in it (such as %-3d instead of %d) causing such messages
	to be longer than necessary
the number printed out for damage by stethoscope or wand of probing is 
	completely incorrect
sometimes your dog would turn into a bat (retaining the same name and 
	tameness) when saving and restoring,going down and back up
	and in bones levels
ghosts on bones levels are replaced by little dogs
if you are polymorphed and drink a potion of healing which raises your
	maximum monster hit points, your current hit points only are raised, so
	you may have (for instance) 37 out of 36 hit points
when you pick up something from a shop, the message is something like
	"For you, kind sir, only 5 for this <garbage>" on systems where
	pointer is not the same size as integer
removing a leash from a dog produces garbage, and also can sometimes
	crash the game
when the Wizard is mentioned, you get garbage
if you tame a wild dog, and then try to hit it, the safe-attack routine
	says "You stop to avoid hitting .", or sometimes garbage
when you are invisible but can see invisible, drinking at a fountain which
	dries up causes your symbol to be erased from the screen.
pushing an enormous rock onto a teleport trap deletes it instead of 
	teleporting it
sometimes returning to human form from a polymorph would leave you with 
	only 1 current hit point left
sometimes polymorphing would leave you with an 18/** strength
if you used a stethoscope on a wall and a creature moved into the revealed
	door before you did, when creature moved off, the door was replaced
	by a wall symbol again, until you walked through it
playing a game with fountain symbols set to one character, and restoring it
	using a configuration file having them set to a different character,
	leaves the fountain symbols as the old character
problem with food poisoning and blindness where you could end up permanently 
	blind, not even reversible by healing etc.
you could not wish for a C-ration or K-ration due to lowercase conversion
zapping a wand of death at yourself, and the death touch of a demon
	prince, killed you even if you were polymorphed into an undead,
	but bouncing death rays didn't
if you threw an object in a shop, it landed on the floor still unpaid
	zapping a wand of cancellation at yourself turned all your objects to
	-1 instead of +0; -1 was only needed for wands (since cancelling wands 
	to +0 allowed a sneaky way of getting infinite wishes)
#remove command is incorrectly described as removing a cursed
	object, but it actually removes only iron balls
at least some messages given for special abilities when you are polymorphed
	printed out the monster type even if you were blind
wishing for a scroll of mail, with MAIL undefined, is permitted but
	reading the scroll gave an "impossible" error message; change it to
	read: "This seems to be junk mail directed to the finder of the Eye 
	of Larn."
if you were blind, effects of scrolls, et al, still said things such as
	"Your mace glows green for a moment," "Your left ring glows white"
the message "The xan pricks your ___ leg" still mentions the type of
	monster (xan) when you are blind
polymorphing could change your gender, but when the game ended you were 
	still described as a "Cave-man" or "Priest" instead of 
	"Cave-woman" or "Priestess"
if you got rocks by using a pick-axe on an enormous rock, the rocks 
	started out blessed
if you escaped from a shop by throwing your iron ball to the exit, the ball
	would stay unpaid
any object thrown in a shop stayed unpaid, and you had to
	pick the object up again and then drop it for it to become paid
if you were invisible but could see invisible, when you drank from a fountain
	that dried up, your symbol got erased from the screen
several times colors were mentioned (i.e. black glows when you pray too much)
	but the colors weren't always changed for hallucination
if punished and your chain and 1 other object is on the floor, you
	get asked if you want to pick up a specific type of object, 
	and the chain is given as one of the possible objects
if you polymorph into a "new man", your energy points never change
trolls, when killed, can leave bodies or objects, but they should
	always leave bodies so they can regenerate back to life, 
	whether or not they left objects
demon prince demanding bribe gets randomly relocated instead of being placed 
	next to you
if you polymorph another tool into a magic marker, the marker always starts
	out dried out
hallucination has the problem that if you do something which takes no time,
	the monsters still change
if you tried drinking at a fountain while levitating, you got asked if you 
	wanted to drink, and then you weren't allowed to do it, and 
	the fountain could still dry up
if you were fire resistant and a magic trap produced a tower of flame, you 
	also get a second message (a shiver...)
when restoring a game, if there was an error, your saved game still vanishd
	for some errors
pets were always referred to as "him" in the leash code
stethoscope in the up or down direction while swallowed referred to "floor" 
	and "ceiling" instead of to the monster that swallowed you
if you could not save a game, the screen cleared and you were told to 
	"Continue or Quit", but if you typed C, the game thought you just 
	gave it a Call command
you could get told "that spellbook was a mimic" even if mimic was on a wall
if you were turning to stone and you polymorphed yourself into a 'c', you 
	still died from the stoning
if you interrupted the program before it finished loading a saved game,
	you were asked if you want your possessions identified
"ctmp" was mistakenly used in MHITU.C when being hit by a rust monster
	rusting your helmet but it should have been "!mtmp->mcan"


Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes
-----------------------------------------
PC: often the same character class, and same player name, will end up
	getting 2 scores on the high score list
PC: if your name contained a period and you were playing on a PC, you would
	 have problems saving games since your save-file name still contained
	 2 periods and would thus be illegal; change periods to underscores 
	when figuring out what the save file should be called
PC: if you polymorphed into a "new man", and changed your name, when you saved
	your game the game was still saved under a filename derived from your
	old name, and to restore that game you had to specify your old name

General New Features
--------------------
when polymorphed into a giant you are now able to pick up and
	throw rocks by giving infinite carrying capacity
give the Healer a pair of gloves (the most logical piece of armor
	for a physician to start out with)
give the Healer a lot of money to start with (doctors are supposedly
	rich, you see)
have the Healer start out with the healing, cure blindness spells 
	already known
create a "trial mode", similar to Wizard Mode where you get a wand of wishing
	with charges and you can't get on the high score list
if you are standing on a trapdoor and you type a '>' symbol,
	print "You jump down the hole." and go down to the next level
