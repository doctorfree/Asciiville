fix crash occuring when self-hit by uncaught boomerang
when delivering a pline message during level change, don't display areas of
	the new level using line-of-sight data from the old one
heavy iron balls may be thrown multiple spaces (presumably they roll),
	restoring old ball behavior
get rid of "non-null minvent despite MM_NOINVENT" warning
prevent a negative damage adjustment from boosting a target monster's HP
give "bashing" message when first attacking something with unconventional
	wielded items besides just throwing weapons and non-weapon tools
when restoring, reset weapon so that "bashing" message can be given again
hole traps in bones data shouldn't be marked as unseen
when carrying 52 items, don't check shop goods for mergability with invent

fix to prevent kicked objects which stop on holes/downstairs from becoming
	unattached from any object list

	door from outside
account for case of monster throwing gem at PC unicorn
schedule repair for shop door smashed by big monster
update status line for energy used when "you fail to cast the spell correctly"

fix relmon panic when bashing weak undead with wielded potion of holy water
holy and unholy water can trigger transformation in werecritters
call update_inventory() when discovering or undiscovering (call " ") an object
fix goto_level panic: if quest leader seals portal, delete portal trap from
	quest home level as well as from main dungeon's branch level [possible

monsters going through endgame portals arrive in same area as the player
	instead of ending up at the portal to the next level
treat most of the moat on fakewiz levels as outside the special central
	area, so that falling or wading into the water and auto-teleporting
	out of it can't strand the character inside the room
monsters created by animating a named figurine will inherit that name
prevent possible player-controlled creation of unique monsters via tossing
	statues of such onto statue trap locations
activating a statue trap with wand or pick-axe won't discard statue contents
cursed non-weapons can't slip when thrown, as it was in 3.1.x
don't reveal patron deity of high priests with the 'C' command's prompt
two flags structures now, flags and iflags, the latter not saved with the game
object name prefix buffer wasn't big enough for biggest possible case
negatively enchanted weapons thrown by monsters could do negative damage
prevent xorns from phazing through walls on astral level
live Wizard won't teleport to your level if he's carrying the Amulet
can't use 'C' to give the Wizard a name
fix charging for shop goods broken via striking/force bolt
prevent disintegration breath from destroying Famine and Pestilence
	and from triggering impossible("monster with zero hp?") for Death
prevent attached ball and/or chain from becoming part of iron golem formed
	during polypiling (ball & chain movement later accessed freed memory,
