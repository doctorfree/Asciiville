Sheol - The icy cold netherworld.
(c) 2012 Mikko Juola

    Sheol is a branch in Gehennom that features more danger and less
    tediousness.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    It adds:

    - Ice walls and crystal ice walls
      They act like normal walls but can be melted with a wand
      of fire. Crystal ice walls are immune to everything except
      fire and crystal picks. Ice walls can be shattered with
      a mattock or a pick-axe but wands of digging don't work
      on them.

    - Ice traps
      Like fire traps but ice you instead. Protect your potions!

    - New monsters:
      Crystal ice golem, ice golem, black angel, chillbug, Punisher,
      white naga and the Executioner. Many of these have abilities
      not seen in vanilla. Some are highly dangerous!

    - New items:
      crystal pick
      It can dig crystal ice walls and has high damage.

    - New levels:
      Sheol has a new map generator and some hand-made levels.

      Vlad has been put inside Sheol. It will be found somewhere below or at
      the middle level of Sheol.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    This branch is aimed at experienced players who think Gehennom is too
    easy or too tedious. It provides a refreshing change to all those
    mazes.
