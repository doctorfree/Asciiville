UPDATE10

Patch 10 to NetHack 3.0 adds no new features, and few optimizations.
It fixes many mostly rare bugs and extends support to a couple more
system variants.

The major change with this patch is that the MSDOS overlay manager is
now bright enough to split up one logical executable among several disk
files, thus simplifying distribution via floppies since each file can
be <360K.  Entering debugging mode for the Macintosh is simplified.
There are provisions for later versions of several compilers, although
not yet Turbo C++, as we have not gotten an executable with adequate
performance (see Install.ovl for gory details).

NetHack should now get along better with Irises, IBM RS/6000s, NeXTs,
and possibly even SCO UNIX.

Among the dead bugs are those involving artifact damage, VMS file
manipulation, crushed iron balls, elven equipment, orcs with 2^32-1
daggers, trolls with ridiculously high hitpoints, exploding bags of
holding on the ground, inappropriate messages, saved luck, unbounded
digging on special levels, and several distinct trap problems.
