# Migrate GPG Keys from One Workstation to Another #

# Replace **[your key]** with your key ID

# To obtain your key ID
# ```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
# ```

# Which returns something like
# ```bash
# /home/angela/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
# -------------------------------
# sec   rsa4096/[your key] 2018-03-30 [SC]
#       ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
#       uid                 [ unknown] angela (KEY NAME) <user@domain>
#       ssb   rsa4096/ABCDEFGHIJKL 2018-03-30 [E]
# 
#       ```
# 
#       After the key size `rsa4096/` is your key ID.
# 
#       ***
# 
#       Export the key in preparation to move it
#       ```bash
#       gpg --export -a [your key] > gpg-pub.asc
#       ```
# 
#       Prepare the secret key for migration (if password protected, you'll be prompted to enter it)
#       ```bash
#       gpg --export-secret-keys -a [your key] > gpg-sc.asc
#       ```
# 
#       Find them
#       ```bash
#       ls -l gpg*.asc
#       ```
# 
#       Drag the key pair from the current directory to your USB stick or however else you move them.
# 
# 
#       Once on the new machine, import them
#       ```bash
#       gpg --import gpg-pub.asc
#       ```
# 
#       If password protected, you'll be prompted to enter it
#       ```bash
#       gpg --import gpg-sc.asc
#       ```
# 
#       If you need to adjust the trust level
#       ```bash
#       gpg --edit-key [your key]
#       ```
